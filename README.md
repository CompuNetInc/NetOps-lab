# NetOps-lab
Test Project for CompuNet NetOps Class

According to Network World (https://www.networkworld.com/article/3187405/lan-wan/netops-can-networks-be-both-available-and-agile.html):

"NetOps specifically focuses on the philosophies, practices, and tools in building and operating the network to deliver and respond quickly to application and user service needs. It does this by linking network change with the applications and services being delivered in real time. This requires automated workflows and analytics that connect the network not only to the teams and systems for the network, but also to the engineering teams and systems for the applications, user services and other infrastructure."
